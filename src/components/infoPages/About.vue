            ReCheck Documents is a service platform that allows you to safely and securely
            keep your valued documents in digital format. It uses the blockchain as a reliable
            storage mechanism and cryptography to encrypt the file and put it safely in an
            unalterable registry. What’s more, those two technologies allow you to securely
            exchange these documents through email or messaging platforms by creating a unique
            link to the document. However, if you are still not sure about the authenticity
            of the document you’ve received, you can upload the document and see if it exists
            in our system. Thus you protect yourself, and the party you are communicating with,
            from phishing and other cyber attacks.
          </p>
          <p>We encourage you to use ReCheck Documents because :</p>

            <li>Uploading the document is creating permanent digital timestamp, as proof of possession.</li>
